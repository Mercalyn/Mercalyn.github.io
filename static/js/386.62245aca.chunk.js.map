In school I would often code choose-your-own text adventure games using the built-in Windows BATCH. In the Army I learned basic electronics and signal-flow in the telecom field. After the Army I learned a good deal of front-end stack, Javascript, jQuery, leading on to React when it became popular. I worked as a freelance front-end website developer in between other jobs.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    \r\n                </Col>\r\n            </Row>\r\n            <Row className=\"mt-4\">\r\n                <Col>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        Since then I've worked odd jobs at Deer Valley Ski Resort where I wrote them a lightning-fast internal utility for their nametag system(demo below), and various construction and agriculture jobs where among other tasks, I would repair or install electrical devices(cameras, ethernet cable, dashboard switches). I've been learning machine learning and neuro-evolution, and am creating my own Node.js library from scratch just to prove I understand the base concepts.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p className=\"mt-5\">\r\n                        And as you can imagine, I am the family's IT gal.
